# Econobiology
Source code for the paper "Analogous processes to ecological interactions and dispersal shape the dynamics of economic activities" by Boussange, V., Sornette, D., Lischke, H., Pellissier, L.


This repository contains the code used for the paper 

> *Processes analogous to ecological interactions and dispersal shape the dynamics of economic activities*, Boussange, V., Sornette, D., Lischke, H., Pellissier, L. (2023).

- `MiniBatchInference.jl/` contains the source code for the inference utilities. It corresponds to a legacy version of [PiecewiseInference.jl](https://github.com/vboussange/PiecewiseInference.jl).
- `Econobio.jl/` contains generic utility functions to pre- and post-process data, and implements the dynamic community models.
- `code/` contains all scripts related to the specific simulation runs
- `figure/` contains all scripts to generate the manuscript figures and crunch the raw simulation results.

All scripts are written in the Julia programming language. A short description of the purpose of each script is placed in each script preamble. The scripts can be executed out of the box by activating the environment stored in the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files in the root folder.

To activate the environment in an interactive session, type in the Julia REPL

```julia
julia>] activate .
julia>] instantiate
```
To simply run a script, type in the terminal
```
> julia --project=. name_of_the_script.jl
```
