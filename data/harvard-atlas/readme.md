Trade values are in current dollar values. The values when sent by reporters are sometimes in dollars but mostly in national currency. After validating the data we apply the exchange rate and upload to our Comtrade database. You can find the exchange rate applied if you look in the 'Explanatory Notes' link in Comtrade for that particular country.
